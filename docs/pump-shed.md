## 3. Maintenance & Documentation To-Do

Several items require further documentation to complete the manual for this critical system. See the `checklists/property_maintenance_checklist.md` for details.

- **Well Information:** Obtain well depth, pump specs, GPM, and drilling records.
- **Electrical & Controls:** Document full specs for the Franklin Electric and PumpSaver controls.
- **Distribution Mapping:** Trace and label the water distribution lines to each building.
