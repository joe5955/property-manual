## Irrigation System

The Main House has a sprinkler system controlled by a Rain Bird ESP-ME3 controller. The controller is located in a wall-mounted cabinet and is WiFi-ready. It supports multiple programs (A, B, C, D) and is compatible with weather and flow sensors. A hand-drawn map of the sprinkler head locations is available.

> **Note:** As of the last update, the irrigation system was turned OFF.
