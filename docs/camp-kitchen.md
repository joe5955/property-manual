## Maintenance Notes

- **Refrigerator (Amana TX18VW):** Manufactured in 1997 — approximately 29 years old. Replacement is strongly recommended due to age and energy inefficiency.
- **Water Heater (Rinnai R75LS):** Currently set at 135°F. Verify temperature setting periodically and flush annually per manufacturer recommendations.
- **Winterization:** Shut off water supply and drain all lines before the first frost to prevent pipe damage.
- **Generator:** Follow the posted switchover instructions carefully. Ensure generator is warmed up before transferring load.
