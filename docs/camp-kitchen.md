## Utilities & Systems

The Camp Kitchen is serviced by a dedicated electrical sub-panel, with the transformer enclosure and meter located nearby. Water is supplied to an outdoor sink with hot and cold water from the Rinnai tankless water heater, and an exterior spigot is also available. The water system must be winterized (drained) in freezing months to prevent damage.

> **Maintenance Note:** Check propane tank levels for the stove and grill before large gatherings. Ensure the water lines are properly drained before the first frost.
