## Root Cellar

The root cellar is a historic log-construction outbuilding built into the hillside at the edge of the garden area. It features a gable roof, a weathered wood door with a window pane, and is accessed via a flagstone path through a rustic wooden gate. Large boulders frame the entrance, and dried hydrangeas grow along the sides. The forested hillside with tall conifers forms the backdrop.
