## 2. Power Switchover Procedure

The manual transfer switch is located inside the genset shed. The following procedure is based on the handwritten instructions posted on the wall.

### To Switch to Generator Power:
1.  **Turn on OPALCO flood light.** (This likely serves as a visual indicator that grid power is active).
2.  **Turn the main transfer switch handle to the middle "OFF" position.**
3.  **Start the generator** using the control panel (Run/Start/Stop switch) and allow it to warm up for a few minutes.
4.  **Turn the main transfer switch handle up to the "GENSET" position.**

### To Switch Back to OPALCO (Grid) Power:
1.  **Turn the main transfer switch handle to the middle "OFF" position.**
2.  **Turn off the generator** using the control panel.
3.  **Turn the main transfer switch handle down to the "OPALCO" position.**
4.  **Turn off the OPALCO flood light.**

## 3. Electrical Distribution

The generator feeds a main distribution panel in the shed, which then supplies power to multiple buildings.

### Main Distribution Panel (Square D QO)
This panel distributes power from the generator or OPALCO to the various buildings and circuits.
